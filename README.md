## 🧠 Problem

Support teams can’t manually track every comment, review, or post about their brand.  
By the time negative feedback trends are noticed on Twitter, Reddit, or app reviews — it’s often too late, and reputation is already affected.

- 🌍 Monitors customer feedback across multiple platforms  
- 🧭 Detects spikes in negative sentiment automatically  
- ⚙️ Prioritizes critical issues by severity
